# Epic Battle
## A mobile-first app which allows a user to enter some initial starting values, then unleash an epic online battle.

### How does it work?

This is a simple web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavsScript.  The HTML consists of a header image and a form used to select some initial values such as the names, health, and "power" of the hero and villian.  Once the battle is initiated, the UI displays the status of the battle on a round-by-round basis; a button allows the user to move the battle forward.  Ultimately a winner is determined and the user is encouraged to play again.

### Improvements
- There are almost no styles for this app; these must be added in order to improve the UI and make it mobile-friendly.
- Form validation:  while the inputs are required, there is nothing stopping anyone from entering unexpected values into the inputs, such as negative numbers, decimals, or spaces without any additional characters.
